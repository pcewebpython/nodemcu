DC motor control over WiFi
1. The NodeMCU board pin 12 and pin 13 is connected to the motor driver (L293D)
pin 2 and pin 7 to control the motor rotating forward or backward or stop.
The pin values corresponding to motor direction is as follows:
Pin2 = 0 Pin7 = 0 ---> motor stop
Pin2 = 1 Pin7 = 0 ---> motor forward
Pin2 = 0 Pin7 = 1 ---> motor backward
There are four buttons on our motor control web page for controlling motor's
on/off/forward/backward.

2. The speed of the motor is also controlled by sending different PWM duty cycle
through pin14 to the L293D enable pin.
We have four button on our motor control web page for controlling the speed:
25 duty cycle, 50 duty cycle, 75 duty cycle and 100 duty cycle.

3. The speed of the motor can also be controlled by a position transducer using
the only analog input pin A0. The analogy input pin converts the position
transducer voltage output into digital value(0, 1023). This digital value is then
used as input parameter for the pwm.duty() function to control the speed of the
motor seamlessly. We have a button on our motor control web page to test this
stepless speed control.
